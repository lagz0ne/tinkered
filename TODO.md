# TODO

The live working list. **Goal: drive it to empty.** Each item is checkable and carries a
**Verify** — the exact observable proof. Tick `[x]` ONLY after the Verify passes (gate green,
a failing→passing test, or command output). Never tick on intent. Add/split items freely.

## Now

Empty. Candidates, none started: a non-Suspense `useResource` was added as an option (done); the cold DI
gap to InferDI (~3.6x at `425b1cd`) is structural and parked; next integration tier per
`docs/decisions/0034-clock-is-an-ambient-ctx-capability.md` is the user's call.

## Shipped — archived

Both v1 milestones are complete. Full ticket detail, budgets, and reset recipes live in the
durable trackers (this list is just the pointer):

- **clock v1** — complete and shipped (t20–t23, tags `core/t20`…`core/t23`, ADR 0034): ambient `Clock`
  on every ctx, `makeTestClock` (now/advance/setTime), virtual + real `sleep` with signal abort, forced
  close cancels an in-flight sleep; validation milestone green (validate lanes, mutation 79.13%, cast-free
  README + example). Detail: `docs/roadmap/clock-v1/PROGRESS.md`.
- **perf batch (2026-09-16)** — ctx classes with prototype `signal`, shared obs/trap objects, one record
  lookup per build, lazy deps without a per-build Map (astra SHIP after 4 rounds); cold make+resolve
  3353 → ~715 ns, op run 532 → ~134 ns. Rules: coding-convention "Performance" + census P01–P04.
  Notes: `research/learnings/2026-09-16-core-vs-inferdi.md`.
- **react/store perf vs the field (2026-09-16)** — six-library bench (`bench/react-stores.mjs`,
  `bench/stores-probe.mjs`); tinker first on mount (535 µs) and update (69.5 µs) vs Zustand, Jotai,
  Legend v2/v3, Preact Signals. Landed: per-cell watchers, 3-hook `useData`, data controller record
  fast path, op run path trims (op 134→79 ns). Gate 808d289: validate PASS, mutation 78.29%.
  Notes: `research/learnings/2026-09-16-react-stores.md`.
- **react options (2026-09-16)** — `useResolve` in react-query mutation shape; `useData({ writable })`
  and `useResource({ suspense: false })` as options, not new hooks (ADR 0032 amended).
- **core v1** — complete: packaged scope, data (read/write/watch), operations, tags, sessions,
  structured close, sync/async resources + targets, outcome hooks + `session(fn)`, release +
  cascade, observation, presets, static meta (t01–t18); teardown/lifetime redesign lt1–lt4
  (`ctx.defer`/`ctx.signal`, reverse-registration LIFO, `close()` returns a `Result` and never
  throws, close is a shutdown MODE — ADRs 0024–0029); v1 validation gate green (t19).
  Detail: `docs/roadmap/core-v1/PROGRESS.md`; budgets `budgets.md`; teardown `teardown-redesign.md`.
- **react v1** — complete: `ScopeProvider`/`SessionProvider`, `useScope`, `useData` (+ selector),
  `useController`, `useResource`, `useResolve`, `useRelease`, `useSpans` (r01–r17, all
  astra-reviewed to SHIP; r16 span emission reverted post-v1). Detail:
  `docs/roadmap/react-v1/PROGRESS.md`.
