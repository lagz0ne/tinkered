## Operation input

Pass outside data with `scope.run(op, { rawInput: value })`. Core runs the operation's
input reader before its body. Pass an already typed value with
`scope.run(op, { input: typedValue })`; that path trusts the value and skips parsing.
Tests of rejected outside input should use `rawInput` or the real HTTP/CLI/tool entry.

## Extensions

An extension is middleware over the scope's verbs (ADR 0050). Declare it with
`extension({ label, start, close })`, install it at the composition root with
`createScope({ extensions })`, wait with `await scope.ready`, and read its
value with `scope.resolve(ext)`.

```ts
import { createScope, extension } from "@tinker/core";

const events = extension({
  label: "events",
  start: (scope, ctx, next) => {
    ctx.defer((end) => console.log("closed:", end.status));
    return next().then(() => ({ connect: () => true }));
  },
  close: (opts, next) => next(),
});

const scope = createScope({ extensions: [events] });
await scope.ready;
scope.resolve(events).connect();
await scope.close({ graceful: true });
```

A `resolve` hook wraps snapshot reads on the root handle (first registered is outermost; skip
`next()` to short-circuit with a substitute):

```ts
const gate = extension({
  label: "gate",
  resolve: (target, next) => (allowed ? next() : "denied"),
});
```

A `run` hook wraps operation calls on the root handle (first registered is outermost; skip
`next()` to refuse a call with a substitute):

```ts
const audit = extension({
  label: "audit",
  run: async (_op, _call, next) => {
    console.log("before");
    const out = await next();
    console.log("after");
    return out;
  },
});
```

Await `ready` before the first `resolve(ext)`.

A `write` hook wraps cell writes on the root handle (first registered is outermost; skip
`next()` to refuse a write, leaving the value and watchers unchanged):

```ts
const even = extension({
  label: "even",
  write: (_cell, value, next) => {
    if (typeof value !== "number" || value % 2 === 0) next();
  },
});
```

A request's reads, calls, and writes are not wrapped yet: sessions created from an extended
scope read, run, and write with the plain dispatch (the v1 limit). A write that reaches the cell
through a `depends: { x: cell.controller }` edge inside an operation runs on the layer directly
and is not wrapped either (the v1 limit).

## Resource cleanup

Stop in-flight work through `ctx.signal`. A forced close aborts the signal, waits for
in-flight operations and resource builds to settle, then runs resource `ctx.defer` hooks.
Waiting until `defer` to stop work that close is waiting for can deadlock.

An async factory can register `ctx.defer` after an `await`, up until its returned promise
settles, including while close waits for that factory. Registration after the factory has
settled throws `Disposed`.

After an `await`, the signal may already be aborted. Use `ctx.signal.throwIfAborted()`
before starting more work. When forwarding cancellation to a separate `AbortController`,
check `ctx.signal.aborted` first: abort it immediately if true; otherwise add the abort
listener. A listener added after abort will not fire. For lazy work, check again at the
point that actually starts it.

## Closing and cell writes

Core seals a layer's cell writes when its close begins. Later writes throw `Disposed`,
including writes through held controllers from an abort
listener, an operation catch, or a resource `defer`. A forced close cannot record a final
status in that layer's cells. Read the returned `Scope.Result` instead: a clean forced close
is `cancelled`; a real failure can make it `failed`.

`close({ graceful: true })` waits for work to finish without first aborting it. Use plain
`close()` when the work needs a stop signal. The first close call chooses the mode; a later
forced close does not upgrade a graceful close already in progress.

## Sessions and cell writes

A child session inherits its parent's cells until it writes its own value. That write stays
in the child's copy: it does not change the parent or notify the parent's watchers. Closing
the child does not merge its cell values back into the parent.

A driver whose shared state belongs to the source scope must read and write through that
scope's handle, such as `scope.controller(cell).set(value)`. A cell controller supplied in
a session operation's `depends` writes to that session.

## Tags

`scope.resolve(tag.all)` returns bindings nearest layer first, and last binding first
within each layer. For example, bindings `[region("first"), region("last")]` are read as
`["last", "first"]`. A driver that needs declaration order must arrange that order itself.

A custom binding builder names the value types it can return in `Tag.Binding<T>`. A binding
with a narrower value type can be assigned to one with a wider union of value types.

## Observation

Enable `observe.history` to retain a bounded list of completed spans for `scope.spans()`.
Each resource build emits a `resource` span, so tests can count builds without a test-only
hook. If you keep the scope handle, its retained history is still readable after close.

When a driver creates its own scope and returns only its result (as the CLI does), pass
`observe.export` in the scope options before starting it. The callback receives each span
as it ends, including spans that finish during close; save those spans outside the driver.
Export works without retained history.
